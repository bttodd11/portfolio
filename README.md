Portfolio

Description - This is my personal portfolio that is currently LIVE. What I was going of with this portfolio was to make a simply web layout but wanted to incorportate my love for baseball inside this portfolio. The idea is to make a webpage similar to a baseball trading card for the main hero 
images. I wanted this to have a projects tab that will take you to another page with a detailed description of each project in a grid view.


Tech - The technologies I used is simple just React, React-Bootstrap and some CSS. React was not really needed I just wanted some practice using React and wanted to keep my portfolio up to date.


Install - If you would like to run this on your local machine then clone the project, run npm install, and then npm start and the project will launch on your localhost:3000


Deployment - This project is deployed using GH-Pages
